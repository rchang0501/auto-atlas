### About Auto Atlas
Rejuvenate is a skincare management app that is **built natively for iOS and  Android.** The goal of the application is to enable the user to effectively manage their skincare routine; specifying the product to use, the date and time to use it, as well as adding additional notes such as usage instructions. A skincare and wellness angle was taken to build this routine management app due to a growing intersection between mobile technologies and the beauty/wellness industry. Strong marketing efforts from industry giants such as Sephora have begun driving a trend of having your phone be the primary hub for beauty/wellness browsing and purchasing. Rejuvenate will thus benefit a wide audience of users to ensure they are scheduling and managing their routines to best meet their skincare goals.
